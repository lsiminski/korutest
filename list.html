          The Oblique Strategies are a deck of cards by Peter Schmidt and Brian Eno. The cards each contained one aphorism to help break creative blocks. Peter and Brian would use the cards in their artistic endeavors. Brian Eno’s <cite>Before and After Science</cite> album famously used the cards in its production (the album also included prints from Peter Schmidt in its original vinyl pressing). The point of the strategies is to provide a prompt to be followed however you see fit in the current piece of work you are immersed in. The decks have gone through several printings. This list collects all of them (or at least as many as I could find). Good luck.

        <p>Some entries have been subtly edited, some entries omitted, and some entries duplicated with slightly different wordings. Enjoy.</p>
